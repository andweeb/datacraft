  <h1>VE Datapak<br/>By Parallel Domains, contact: data@paralleldomains.com</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p class="intro">
    In the era of big data, there are many daunting challenges as well as
    exciting opportunities for IT research.  While some are classic challenges
    taken to unprecedented scales, others are completely new.
    In this era, it is crucial to have a common dataset for validating
    research ideas, prototypes, as well as to publish and share results
    without sharing your proprietary information.  The VE Datapak is a data product created
    just for that purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
    The VE Datapak contains data that can uncover insights into 
    how large numbers of individual players collaborate (i.e. '<em>chat</em>')
    or compete (i.e. '<em>kill</em>') with each other in thirteen different virtual
    universes in a massively multiplayer online game ("<em>MMOG</em>").
    While some users play solely in one universe, others play across
    multiple universes. The time span for game play is four weeks of
    wall clock time, on a granularity of minutes. With each update,
    the timespan grows continually by four more weeks.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Please Note</strong>: <em>The latest copy of this document
    can always be found at <a href="http://paralleldomains.com/readme.html"
    >paralleldomains.com/readme.html</a>, and the VE Datapak may be
    found at <a href="http://data.paralleldomains.com/"
    >data.paralleldomains.com</a></em>.
  </p>


  <h3>Where is the dataset from</h3>

  <p>
    The VE Datapak has been created by recording activity on thirteen servers
    hosting a popular networked game called <b>Minecraft</b>. The dataset is
    heavily anonymized.
  </p>

  <p>
    Servers are identified by random strings, such as [<samp>509fb8211dbf9d6b7e000004</samp>]. 
    Players are identified by random strings, such as [<samp>baba27973f7f497e51d553f0b233ba7df42ac8ae</samp>].
    For researchers studying <b>game addiction or behaviors</b>, this dataset
    will provide valuable information on game play. 
    For confidentiality, we provide the time zone from which the players 
    logged on but obfuscate their precise location.
  </p>

  <p>
    All data records have been consolidated into a single csv file.  Each
    record documents a different temporal interval, either a total count
    of an event in that time period, or an average of a system performance
    metric.  Each comma separated line has 8 fields. For each record, 
    fields irrelevant to the event are left blank.
    <ol>
        <li> <samp>start_t</samp>: start time of a time interval
        <li> <samp>stop_t</samp>:  stop time of a time interval
        <li> <samp>server_id</samp>: id of the game server from which the event is collected 
        <li> <samp>player_a</samp>: the id of the primary player in this event
        <li> <samp>player_b</samp>: the id of the secondary player in this event
        <li> <samp>key</samp>: key describing the type of the event
        <li> <samp>meta</samp>: meta data describing the event
        <li> <samp>count</samp>: a numeric attribte describing the event (int or float)
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    The first three fields are always populated: 
    <samp>start_t</samp>, <samp>stop_t</samp> and <samp>server_id</samp>.
    The time data is reported in minutes in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). 
    All time intervals in VE Datapak lasts a minute or more.
    The start day has been
    anonymized. A time value of 0 means 00 hour, 00 minute on the first
    day of data collection.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are only two activity types involving two players: Chat and
    KilledBy, both of which define one-directional relationship.  
    Those records look like the following example, where the two records
    come from the same one-minute interval: <samp>24780-24781</samp>
    on the same server [<samp>509fb8211dbf9d6b7e000004</samp>].
    The fields of <samp>player_a</samp> and <samp>player_b</samp> are populated.
    The field "key" describes the action: <samp>KilledBy</samp> for the first example and
    <samp>Chat</samp> for the other.
  </p>

  <div class="code_wrapper">
    <pre><samp>********* Two-Player Events **********
24780, 24781, 509fb8211dbf9d6b7e000004, 1bbe90a19292f745edd527085838d6b0b77d67a5, baba27973f7f497e51d553f0b233ba7df42ac8ae, KilledBy, , 1
24780, 24781, 509fb8211dbf9d6b7e000004, 56dfed03423fb02bdabd40367bf5310f5f00cc34, baba27973f7f497e51d553f0b233ba7df42ac8ae, Chat, , 1 </samp></pre> 
   </div>

  <p>
    In the first record, <samp>player_a</samp> was KilledBy <samp>player_b</samp>, i.e. 
    [<samp>1bbe90a1...</samp>] was killed by [<samp>baba2797...</samp>].
    The <samp>meta</samp> field follows, but for KilledBy events there is no meta data.
    The last <samp>count</samp> field shows that this KilledBy event took place once.
    Using this convention, it's easy to parse out that the 2nd record record
    says: on the same server during the same one-minute interval,
    <samp>player_a</samp> [<samp>56dfed03...</samp>] Chatted with 
    <samp>player_b</samp> [<samp>baba2797...</samp>] once.
    Please note - Chat is a one-way event, where player_a spoke to player_b.
    If player_b spoke back, it will be counted as another one-way event.
  </p>

  <p>
    Game playing events about a single player look like the following:
  </p>

  <div class="code_wrapper">
    <pre><samp>********* Single-Player Events **********
25320, 25321, 509fb8211dbf9d6b7e000004, baba27973f7f497e51d553f0b233ba7df42ac8ae, , BlockBreak, DIRT, 5
25320, 25321, 509fb8211dbf9d6b7e000004, baba27973f7f497e51d553f0b233ba7df42ac8ae, , BlockPlace, SAND, 1
25320, 25321, 509fb8211dbf9d6b7e000004, baba27973f7f497e51d553f0b233ba7df42ac8ae, , CraftedItems, FURNACE, 1
25320, 25321, 509fb8211dbf9d6b7e000004, baba27973f7f497e51d553f0b233ba7df42ac8ae, , CraftedItems, IRON_HELMET, 1
25320, 25321, 509fb8211dbf9d6b7e000004, baba27973f7f497e51d553f0b233ba7df42ac8ae, , CraftedItems, IRON_SWORD, 1
25320, 25321, 509fb8211dbf9d6b7e000004, baba27973f7f497e51d553f0b233ba7df42ac8ae, , CraftedItems, STONE_PICKAXE, 1
24780, 24782, 509fb8211dbf9d6b7e000004, baba27973f7f497e51d553f0b233ba7df42ac8ae, , Death, , 2</samp></pre>
  </div>

  <p>
    In this case, the <samp>player_b</samp> field is empty because the event involves
    only one player - <samp>player_a</samp>.  
    In the first record the <samp>key</samp> field says
    "BlockBreak", and the <samp>meta</samp> field tells which type of block is broken -
    in this case "DIRT". The final <samp>count</samp> field indicates 5 dirt blocks have
    been broken. The next record is a "BlockPlace" event, in which the player
    placed one block of "SAND" type.  The following records are "CraftedItems"
    events, showing that the player [<samp>baba2797</samp>]
    crafted a "FURNACE" (a key in-game crafting tool), 
    an "IRON_HELMET" (armor), an "IRON_SWORD" (weapon) and a "STONE_PICKAXE" (mining tool).
    The last record says that the player died twice (<strong>please note</strong>:
    <em>these death events are single-player deaths, which exclude deaths caused by being 
    killed by another player.</em>). For "Death" events no types are recorded,
    although many possible causes exist, such as creeper explosion, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another type of event are "LOGIN" events. A record looks like:
  </p>

  <div class="code_wrapper">
    <pre><samp>********* Player Login Events **********
25320, 25321, 509fb8211dbf9d6b7e000004, baba27973f7f497e51d553f0b233ba7df42ac8ae, , Logins, America/Los_Angeles, 1 </samp></pre>
  </div>

  <p>
    Login events are not reliable for telling when a player starts to play,
    because a player can stay logged in while being away from the computer.
    We use login events to tell from which time zone the player is from.
    In this case, the player is located in the US west coast time zone
    (America/Los_Angeles). <strong>Please note</strong>:
    <em>the player's geoIP resolved location is hidden and will
    never be provided for confidentiality</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, there are events relating to server operating state.
    These fall into two types: TickRate and Used Memory in Megabytes.
  </p>

  <div class="code_wrapper">
    <pre><samp>********* System Operations Events **********
25320, 25380, 509fb8211dbf9d6b7e000004, , , SysOps, TickRate, 15.96
25320, 25380, 509fb8211dbf9d6b7e000004, , , SysOps, UsedMemMB, 5836.89 </samp></pre>
  </div>

  <p>
    Since these events are server specific, <samp>player_a</samp> and <samp>player_b</samp>
    fields are always empty.  The <samp>key</samp> field is always "SysOps", and
    the <samp>meta</samp> field tells which system operating state is collected.
    These system operation states do not vary too much, we average those
    to hourly granularity.  TickRate is a Minecraft specific way to report
    server lag. The optimal number is above or around 20. When a system is underload and
    system lag increases, the TickRate will drop. A TickRate of 16 or above is considered
    to be very playable. When under severe load,
    the TickRate can be as low as 3 to 5.  System memory usage is very
    straight forward, it in some ways correlate with server load, the more
    game playing activity there is, the more memory is typically in use.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Examples are easier to tell with a hero in the picture.  In the
    above case, it's [<samp>baba2797...</samp>].
    During the minute of <samp>24780-24781</samp>, two players talked to our
    hero (they are: [<samp>56dfed03...</samp>] and [<samp>66a71bd3...</samp>]).  
    During that same minute, our hero killed [<samp>1bbe90a1...</samp>] once.
    During the two minute span of 24780-24782, our hero was killed by
    [<samp>b520e057...</samp>] twice, and also died twice due
    to other causes (possible reasons include creeper explosion, rode a pig 
    off a cliff, etc).  Nine hours later (540 minutes later), our hero came back
    to the same server to play.  In a minute (<samp>25320-25321</samp>), our hero mined
    for blocks (dirt, gravel, sand and other types) and crafted a furnace, and very
    efficiently built weapon, armor etc.
    It seems that our hero had an active Player v. Player (PvP) game play first, 
    and an active survival mode of game play next.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the login events, we can tell that our hero is on US west coast
    (the time zone designation is America/Los_Angeles).  Because 24780 is per
    minute in UTC time, we can convert that to the player's local time as:
    (24780 / 60) % 24 = 5AM UTC, which is about 9PM US west coast time.
    Similarly, 25320 converts to 2PM UTC and 6AM in US west coast time.
  </p>

  <p>
    By following some relationships had by our hero <samp>[baba2797...]</samp>
    we can find out:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Both [<samp>56dfed03...</samp>] and [<samp>66a71bd3...</samp>] are from
        US central time zone, but one is very active and another is a passer-by
      </li>
      <li>
        [<samp>1bbe90a1...</samp>] is a passer-by who played on
        the server once (got killed by our hero once) and never came back.
        We don't know where this player is from, because some IP addresses are
        transient.
      </li>
      <li>
        [<samp>b520e057...</samp>] is another passer-by from time
        zone (Asia/Manila) that killed our hero twice and never came back
      </li>
    </ul>

  <p>
    Similar relationships can be built by following how players chat with
    each other, or according to which players typically play during the same
    time on the same server(s).
  </p>

  <h3>How Large is the VE Datapak?</h3>

  <p>
    The VE Datapak already provides data on 70,000 unique players from
    201 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANA_time_zone_database">IANA Time Zones</a>.
    In the
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones">IANA standard database
    on time zones</a>, the whole world consists of 408 time zones.
  </p>

  <p>
    The servers included in the VE Datapak are very different from each other. 
    Solely from audience perspective, some are geographic region specific, 
    some are language specific (e.g. English speaking vs. Spanish speaking countries), 
    while others are specific to a narrow set of game-playing styles.
    It should be
    extremely interesting for both researchers and game developers
    to pose hypotheses about why some players chose to play on certain servers.
    More interestingly, we note about 2 to 3 thousand players
    (among the 70,000 cohort) played on more than one servers included
    in the VE Datapak, more than 1,000 players changed time zone at
    least once during the 4-week recording period.
  </p>

  <p>
    For researchers that prefer to work with a smaller dataset,
    we have prepared the VE Datapak in two versions: a full version
    and a small version.  Compared to the "full" version, the "small"
    version contains half of the servers and half of the recording period.
    The "small" version is less expensive and does not come with the option 
    to receive monthly update.
  </p>

  <p>
    The VE Datapak will continue to grow as we expand our capacity. The
    "small" version will always remain an up-to-date subset
    of the growing "full" version. For users that have purchased
    the monthly update option, updates to the full version will be
    downloadable from a link automatically emailed to you through our
    monthly news letter.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Please note</strong>: <em>you are more than welcome to first purchase the smallest
    version to play with. If you decide to purchase a larger version, you only
    pay the difference in the price</em>.
  </p>


  <h3>Sample Research and Educational Use</h3>

  <p>
    The VE Datapak already provides data on 70,000 players working alone,
    collaborating, and competing.  
    Using the VE Datapak, almost all graph related solutions can take a firm 
    footing in a practical scenario.
    On the theoretical side, you can test the scalability of your code that
    finds cliques and strongly connected components.  You can also work on
    new algorithms that find cliques of players staying together for more
    than a period of 10 days, for instance.  You can look for friend circles
    with obvious leaders or friend circles with more or less equal peers.
    You can work on methods to efficiently and quickly identify players that
    as a clan compete with players from other clans, while the clans form
    and dissolve over time autonomously.

    For game developers or psychologists interested in studying in-game
    behaviors, Minecraft is an interesting subject because there are
    so many different game-playing styles on typical Minecraft servers.
    Minecraft also seems to have <em>better gender parity than many
    other games</em>.  It would be very
    interesting to study how playing styles together with player interactions
    affect long-term game playing.  In addition, how would one characterize
    player experiences? 
    Whether a player will return to play more on the same server?

    In support of these big data research efforts, we created the VE Datapak
    with a license that provides unrestricted rights to publish your
    research results.  We would also encourage that the VE Datapak be used in
    educational settings, where students of all majors can learn the trade
    of computational thinking.

    by Wong et. al, the VE Datapak is helpful for the following research topics:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>User Driven Data Reduction</li>
    <li>Representing Evidence and Uncertainty</li>
    <li>Analytics for Temporally Evolved Features</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In the framework of

    "Massive Multiplayer Online Gaming: A Research Framework for Military
    Training and Education"
    </a>
    by Bonk and Dennen, the VE Datapak is useful for the following primary
    experiments identified in the report:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Impact of Addiction to MMOG</li>
    <li>Sense of Community and Group Longevity or Persistence</li>
    <li>Describe the Apprenticeship Process in MMOG</li>
    <li>Role Assignment: Achievers, Socializers, Explorers, Killers</li>
    <li>Decision-making, Leadership, and Interpersonal Conflict</li>
    <li>Game-based Motivation</li>
    <li>Social Skills and Friendship Development</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Sample Code</h3>
  <p>
    We have developed and will continue to develop a suite of sample Python 
    scripts for working with the dataset.
    These sample code has been made open source through BSD license on
    <a href="https://github.com/ParallelDomains/VEDatapakExamples">github</a>.
    Those scripts provide many fine grained data processing needs that
    range from simply counting number of unique players in the dataset, 
    to reporting number of unique players that each server sees from different
    IANA timezones. 
    If you would like to participate in our effort to improve the sample codes,
    please join us!
  </p>

  <h3> What About Player Names? </h3>

  <p>
    The player names, location and server names will never be provided
    with the VE Datapak.  If you really just want to refer to things with names,
    we suggest that you try some scripts to auto generate names.
  </p>

  <p>
    One useful name generation tool is
    <a href="http://generators.christopherpound.com">Chris Pound's
    Language Generation Machine</a>, which generates names centered
    around a given theme. It's very fascinating!

  <h3>Hacked Game Clients</h3>
  <p>
  In the world of large scale networked games, cheating or pirating 
  using a hacked game clients is an everyday thing.
  We cannot avoid it, nor should we. In a way, isn't a lot of today's
  cyber security R&D dedicated to detecting such behavior. 
  </p>

  <p> Jokes aside, there is a key event that has to do with how Minecraft
  handles abnormal behavior from a game client.
  Those scenarios include: when a client logs on but cannot provide the
  certificates to authenticate, or a client is causing severe server lag. 
  The first case is more likely someone using a pirated game client,
  while the second case is often related to a player using a hacked client
  to cheat in the game by "flying" and causing server lag for all players
  on the server.

  <p> Regardless of which reason, when abnormal behavior happens, or simply 
  when the server is not allowing new players to join the game, the Minecraft
  server will "kick" the player off the server. These kick events are captured,
  and reported in VE Datapak. The following is a sample record of that.
  In this example, on the same server our hero [<samp>baba2797...</samp>] plays,
  player [<samp>bac6018a...</samp>] got kicked 7 times during a seven-minute
  period. It's normal for a player to get kicked once in a while, but
  this level of kick activity definite incidates potential issues.
  We don't know what's going on in this case, 
  but if you can figure out please let us know.

  The <samp>player_b</samp> and <samp>meta</samp> fields are always left blank.
